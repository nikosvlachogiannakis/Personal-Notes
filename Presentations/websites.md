# Hiring Without Whiteboards

The following repository contains a list of companies (or teams) that don't do 
"whiteboard" interviews."Whiteboards" is used as a metaphor, and is a symbol for the 
kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. 
Whiteboards are not bad â€“ CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode 
probably fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble
 day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take 
home exercise.
